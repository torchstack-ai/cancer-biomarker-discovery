# Cancer Biomarker Discovery Platform

## Overview
This repository contains an example analysis of multiple scRNA-Seq datasets to identify cancer biomarkers, infer mechanistic relationships, and develop a platform that could lead to prognostic evaluation. The client was a startup company we worked with that ended up raising a seed round.

This bioinformatics pipeline analyzes single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to identify therapeutic targets and biomarkers in cancer treatment. We specialize in characterizing tumor heterogeneity and treatment response patterns at single-cell resolution.

## Research Objectives and Pipeline Description

### ðŸ”¬ Advanced Analytics
- **Single-cell Resolution**: Map gene expression patterns in individual cells
- **Treatment Response Profiling**: Discover molecular signatures that distinguish treatment responders from non-responders
- **Tumor Microenvironment Mapping**: Map complex cellular interactions in the tumor ecosystem
- **Immune Cell Profiling**: Analyze immune cell populations and their states in depth

### ðŸ“Š Robust Data Integration
- We integrated multiple scRNA-seq datasets seamlessly
- We corrected batch effects using the Harmony algorithm
- We implemented rigorous quality control and normalization
- We standardized all data processing steps

### ðŸŽ¯ Therapeutic Target Discovery
- We analyzed differential expression across multiple cell populations
- We identified cell-type specific markers
- We performed pathway enrichment analysis
- We classified cell types using machine learning

## Business Value

### For Biotech Companies
- **Accelerate Drug Development**: Find and validate new therapeutic targets faster
