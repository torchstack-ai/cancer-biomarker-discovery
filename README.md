# Cancer Biomarker Discovery Platform

## Overview
Our bioinformatics pipeline analyzes single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to identify therapeutic targets and biomarkers in cancer treatment. We specialize in characterizing tumor heterogeneity and treatment response patterns at single-cell resolution.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”¬ Advanced Analytics
- **Single-cell Resolution**: Map gene expression patterns in individual cells
- **Treatment Response Profiling**: Discover molecular signatures that distinguish treatment responders from non-responders
- **Tumor Microenvironment Mapping**: Map complex cellular interactions in the tumor ecosystem
- **Immune Cell Profiling**: Analyze immune cell populations and their states in depth

### ðŸ“Š Robust Data Integration
- We integrate multiple scRNA-seq datasets seamlessly
- We correct batch effects using the Harmony algorithm
- We implement rigorous quality control and normalization
- We standardize all data processing steps

### ðŸŽ¯ Therapeutic Target Discovery
- We analyze differential expression across multiple cell populations
- We identify cell-type specific markers
- We perform pathway enrichment analysis
- We classify cell types using machine learning

## Business Value

### For Biotech Companies
- **Accelerate Drug Development**: Find and validate new therapeutic targets faster
